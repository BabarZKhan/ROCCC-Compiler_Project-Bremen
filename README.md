# ROCCC HLS Compiler-Project Bremen

While working on various other High-Level Synthesis (HLS) compilers, some years ago I have worked on Riverside Optimizing Compiler for Configurable Computing (ROCCC) High-Level Synthesis compiler as well for an academic research project [FDL2021](https://babarzkhan.github.io/publication/2021-09-09-FDL2021), and [DTA](https://babarzkhan.github.io/publication/2018-03-25). ROCCC is an open source compiler built upon the SUIF (Stanford University Intermediate Format) and Low Level Virtual Machine (LLVM) infrastructures. It raises the level of abstraction for programming FPGAs to a subset of C. My research goals revolved around the procedure level optimizations (passes) and loop level optimizations in the ROCCC HLS Compiler. The changes made in the original source code by me are released under the same original license.

This repository contains both the precompiled distributions, and the source code for the ROCCC project.
